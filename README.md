ENd to End Zomato ML Project


##ABSTRACT

Zomato is one of the top online meal delivery applications, providing users with ratings and reviews on restaurants across India.

These ratings and reviews are regarded as one of the most crucial deciding elements in determining the quality of a restaurant.

As a result, we will employ a real-time data collection containing various elements that a user could check at when looking for a restaurant. In this analysis, we shall take Bangalore City into account.

Content The basic idea behind analyzing the Zomato dataset is to gain a good understanding of the factors influencing the establishment of different types of restaurants in different parts of Bengaluru, as well as the aggregate rating of each restaurant. Bengaluru, for example, has over 12,000 restaurants serving dishes from all over the world.

With new restaurants opening every day, the business is far from saturated, and demand is growing by the day. Despite rising demand, it has become increasingly difficult for new restaurants to compete with existing establishments. The majority of them provide the same dish. Bengaluru is India's IT capital. Because they don't have time to prepare, the majority of the people here rely mostly on restaurant meals.

With such a high demand for eateries, it has become critical to research a location's demographics. What type of cuisine is more popular in a certain area. Do the entire community enjoys vegetarian food? If yes, is that area occupied by a certain sect of people, such as Jain, Marwaris, or Gujaratis, who are usually vegetarians? These kind of analyses may be carried out utilizing data, by investigating aspects like as

• Restaurant location • Food price approximation • Theme-based restaurant or not • Which neighborhood of that city has the most restaurants serving that cuisine?
• The demands of individuals looking for the greatest food in the area • Is a certain neighborhood well-known for its own type of cuisine?
